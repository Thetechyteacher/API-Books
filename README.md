School Library Management System:



Platform created to support the management of a school library, through the use of local storage it allows the user to keep track of books borrowed by who and when through the use of a ISBN code.Tech Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript and APIs - Platform created to support the management of a school library, through the use of local storage it allows the user to keep track of books borrowed by who and when through the use of a ISBN code.


Tech used: HTML5, CSS, Javascript and Apis.

My learning was focused on making a simple UX for this application with local storage, adapting to the needs of the establishment. 


Optimizations

When I improve this project, I would update how the information is collected and displayed on the table, adding a checkbox to select when the book has been returned so it only displays the last person who borrowed the book. 


Lessons Learned:

Improve UX by trialling the app on a pilot project and implementing improvements based on feedback from the pilot.

How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write something. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

Optimizations

(optional)

You don't have to include this section but interviewers love that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are GREAT to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those whoa this is awesome or fuck yeah I did it! moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
