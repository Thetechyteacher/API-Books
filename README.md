Platform created to support the management of a school library, through the use of local storage it allows the user to keep track of books borrowed by who and when through the use of a ISBN code.Tech Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript and APIs - Platform created to support the management of a school library, through the use of local storage it allows the user to keep track of books borrowed by who and when through the use of a ISBN code.


Tech used: HTML5, CSS, Javascript and Apis.

My learning was focused on making a simple UX for this application with local storage, adapting to the needs of the establishment. 


Optimizations

When I improve this project, I would update how the information is collected and displayed on the table, adding a checkbox to select when the book has been returned so it only displays the last person who borrowed the book. 


Lessons Learned:

Improve UX by trialling the app on a pilot project and implementing improvements based on feedback from the pilot.
