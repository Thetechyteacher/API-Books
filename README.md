Platform created to support the management of a <b> school library </b>, through the use of <em>local storage</em> it allows the user to keep track of books borrowed by who and when through the use of a ISBN code.


<h2>Tech used: HTML5, CSS, Javascript and the Open library Api.</h2>

My learning was focused on making a simple UX for this application with local storage, adapting to the needs of the establishment. 


<h2>Optimizations</h2>

When I improve this project, I would update how the information is collected and displayed on the table, adding a checkbox to select when the book has been returned so it only displays the last person who borrowed the book. 


<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>

Improve UX by trialling the app on a pilot project and implementing improvements based on feedback from the pilot.
